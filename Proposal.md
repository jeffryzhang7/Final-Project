# Project Proposal
## 1. The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal.
### My project aims to create software that helps people figure out their monthly housing loan payments in two ways: equal principal or equal installments. I'm also designing a website where users can type in their total payments, the loan terms, and the interest rate. They can then choose how they want to make payments and see how much they need to pay for each period. The site will also show the remianing principal if they want to clear the full amount at any time. I'm planning to link this website to different real estate sites so users can find housing options that fit their budget ranges. The basic version will have accurate loan calculations and an easy-to-use interface.


## 2. Learning Objectives: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.
### By the end of this project, I aim to acquire proficiency in software development, specifically in creating applications for financial calculations and web design. I want to enhance my skills in programming languages and frameworks relevant to the development of more than just a housing loan calculator and an integrated website. Additionally, I seek to deepen my understanding of financial concepts related to housing loans and real estate. Through practical application, I aim to gain hands-on experience in developing a user-friendly interface, implementing accurate loan calculations, and integrating external data sources applying APIs.

## 3. Implementation Plan:  This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.
### I'm not sure what libraries will I use, but I'm sure I will need to use define formulas to calculate the loans and payments, as well as the usage of incorporating APIs, as for the rest of the content, I will consult ChatGPT and professor LI for some suggestions. Besides, I could investigate online via the created projects for similar related topics to see what are better tools/libraries that I should use in my project.


## 4. Project Schedule: You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Draft a general timeline for your project. Depending on your project, you might be able to provide a detailed schedule or only an overview. Preparation of a longer project is also accompanied by present uncertainty, and this schedule will likely require revisions as the project progresses.
### For the week 1 I will be researching about the real estate market and strenghthen my financial knowledge on calculating loansï¼›
### For the week 2-3 I will start to write rough veuso codes in python and aim to run the simplest calculations with formulas created;
### For the week 4-5 I will start to design my websites and start looking for API from different Real Estate agents/companies;
### For the week 6 I will aim to incorporate everything together and complete my entire project.

## 5. Collaboration Plan: How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure.
### N/A

## 6. Risks and Limitations: What do you believe is the most significant threat to this project's success?
### Failed to follow the schedule, lacking sufficient knowledge of the real estate market and related financial knowledges or overuse of the artificial intelligence could result in the significant risks to fail this project. 

## 7. Additional Course Content: What topics do you believe will be beneficial to your project?
### Webtech design and online resouces intergration, as well as the real estate finance.
